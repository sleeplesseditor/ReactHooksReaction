# ReactHooksReaction

A multi-user app built with React Hooks, which allows users to leave messages and react to them with emoticons. The app uses [PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/) to handle its publish/subscription model â€“ you'll need to create a pubNub.config.json file with 'publishKey', 'subscribeKey' and 'secretKey' values to use this app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
